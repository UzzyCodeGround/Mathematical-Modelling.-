# Welcome to My GitHub Projects

This repository is a collection of my projects showcasing some of my work done. 

## Repository Overview

### 1. Mathematical Modeling Projects

This section contains dynamic system models, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, vibration analysis, and thermal models. These projects demonstrate:
- Application of engineering principles to solve complex mechanical systems.
- Use of Python (SciPy, NumPy) to implement models and perform numerical simulations.
- Development of algorithms to solve engineering problems related to system dynamics and control.

#### Key Projects:
- **Pulley System Dynamics**: A project analyzing a multi-storey goods lifting apparatus using vibration theory and dynamic modeling.
- **Solar Heating Modeling**: Models involving heat transfer and energy systems, including solar-based heating systems and insulated environments.
- **Temperature Variation Model**: A finite element analysis of heat transfer across a 2D plate using boundary conditions and mesh optimization to simulate steady-state temperature distribution

These projects have helped hone my mathematical modeling and computational programming skills. Applying my problem-solving skills to a mathematical scenario and then developing an efficient algorithm is a key skill I take away from these projects.
